## Bio

Xavier Salleras is a Cryptography Researcher at [Dusk](https://dusk.network/), working mainly on Zero-Knowledge Proofs. He holds a PhD in Applied Cryptography by Pompeu Fabra University (UPF). Former member of the WiSeCom group and former professor of Cryptography and Security at UPF.

He also holds a Masterâ€™s degree in ICT Security by UOC-UAB-URV, and is graduated in Audiovisual Systems Engineering by UPF.

His main research interests are **applied cryptography** and **wireless networks security**. He developed his PhD [thesis](https://www.tdx.cat/handle/10803/687975#page=1) on how to implement efficient Zero-Knowledge proving systems in embedded systems, with the aim of deploying self-sovereign authentication in different scenarios like mobile communications and Internet of Things (IoT).

## Software

**[ZPiE](https://github.com/xevisalle/zpie).** A portable and efficient C library for developing Zero-Knowledge applications for embedded systems.

**[CryptoolZ](https://github.com/xevisalle/cryptoolz).** A bunch of cryptographic primitives coded in C, intended to be used (but not limited to) in Zero-Knowledge applications.

**[LASER](https://github.com/xevisalle/laser).** Implementation of a secure authentication protocol for Remote Keyless Entry (RKE) systems.
